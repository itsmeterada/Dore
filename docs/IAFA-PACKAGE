Title:             Dore' API (Dynamic Object Rendering Environment)
Version:           6.0
Description:       Dore' is a powerful 3D graphics subroutine library.
                   It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating
                   graphics applications. It is also easy to use, portable,
                   and extendable. This version has interfaces/drivers to
                   X11, PEX, IrisGL, OpenGL, Postscript and more. It has 
                   been ported onto most unix systems, including Linux and
                   FreeBSD. It has also been ported to Windows NT 3.5.
