The goal of the dynamic renderer is to display images as quickly as
possible, so the user can interact with the models in real time.
To this end, it is designed to allow the associated device driver to
take total advantage of available graphics hardware.
For the actual rendering, the dynamic renderer relies on the graphics
pipeline of the device being accessed.
The pipeline usually includes transformation, clipping, scan
conversion, and shading operations. 
Different devices have different pipeline implementations, so the
actual output from the dynamic renderer varies from device to device.

.H1 "Device Driver Support
The dynamic renderer requires the dynamic renderer output module
(DROM) interface in addition to the device control module (DCM) interface.
See Section III of this document for more information on a particular
device driver.
.rs
.sp -.25v
.H1 "Renderer Dependent Functions
The dynamic renderer depends completely on the DROM of the
device driver.  In all cases, this means that the dynamic renderer 
uses a function provided by the DROM of the device driver.
Because of this dependency on the DROM of the particular device driver
being used, the visual results may be quite varied.
See Appendix A, \f2Supported Functions\f1, for the list of
\*(Dd functions that are supported by the dynamic renderer 
through the DROM of the various devices provided with this release.
