.L1 T ITAN " G2"
.L2 D RIVER
.CH TWELVE
.H1 "Overview
The \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 device driver provides access to the
high performance 3D graphics of the Stardent 1500 graphics supercomputers.
The Stardent 1500, manufactured by Stardent Computer, is a double
buffered 24\-bit color workstation that runs the X11+ windowing
system.
.H1 "Using the Driver
The initialization options for the \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 device driver 
are:
.ip "\-noautosize"
requests that the device viewport not be automatically be set to the
device extent when the device extent changes.
.ip "\-singlebuffered"
requests a single buffered window.
The default is a double buffered window.
.ip "\-geometry \f2geomstring\fP"
requests a window with a particular position and size.
The format for \f2geomstring\fP is ``WxH+X+Y'' or ``WxH''
(where W, H, X, and Y are the integer values for width, height,
and the X, Y position of the upper left corner of the window).
If the ``WxH'' format is used, X and Y are assumed to be zero.
.ip "\-visualtype \f2vtype\fP"
requests a window with the given visual type.
The possible values for \f2vtype\fP are \f2DcDirectColor\fP for a full 24\-bit
color window or \f2DcPseudoColor\fP for an 8\-bit pseudocolor window.
.ip "\-window \f2xwindow\fP"
requests that the X window handle \f2xwindow\fP that the application
has opened be used for drawing.
When using this option, the \f2\-display\fP option should also be
specified. 
The \f2\-singlebuffered\fP, \f2\-geometry\fP, and
\f2\-visualtype\fP options are ignored when a window is specified.
.ip "\-display \f2xdisplay\fP"
requests that the X display handle \f2xdisplay\fP that the application
has opened be used as the X display device.
.ip "\-stereo"
requests a stereo window.
.H1 "Output Modules
The \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 device driver supports both the Production Renderer Output Module
Interface and the Dynamic Renderer Output Module Interface.
.lp
The Production Renderer Output Module Interface is very simple, and
all functions are supported.
.lp
The \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 device driver uses most, but not all, of the
\*(Dd attributes that are passed to the Dynamic Renderer Output Module.
.H1 "DROM Dependent Functions
The following subsections list the renderer/DROM specific functions that
are supported by the \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 DROM.
.H2 "Studio Attributes
The studio attributes are attributes that will be executed during a
studio traversal.
Studio attributes include camera attributes, light attributes.
The DROM does not use any of the rendering control attributes.
.H3 "Camera Attributes
The camera attributes supported by the DROM are:
.(l I
DoCameraMatrix <DOCM>
DoParallel <DOPAR>
DoPerspective <DOPER>
DoProjection <DOPRJ>
DoStereo <DOSTER>
DoStereoSwitch <DOSTES>
.)l
.H3 "Lighting Attributes
The light attributes define the characteristics of the lights
used in a scene.
They are:
.(l I
DoLightColor <DOLC>
DoLightIntens <DOLI>
DoLightType <DOLTT>
.)l
.H2 "Primitives
The \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 DROM supports the \f2base\fP primitives of the DROM
interface.
.H2 "Primitive Attributes
The primitive attribute classes fall into several categories, they
include shading, texture mapping and miscellaneous.
.H3 "Shading Attributes
The shading attributes supported by the DROM are:
.(l I
DoAmbientIntens <DOAMBI>
DoAmbientSwitch <DOAMBS>
DoDepthCue <DODC>
DoDepthCueSwitch <DODCS>
DoDiffuseColor <DODIFC>
DoDiffuseIntens <DODIFI>
DoDiffuseSwitch <DODIFS>
DoInterpType <DOIT>
DoLightSwitch <DOLTS>
DoShadeIndex <DOSI>
DoSpecularColor <DOSPCC>
DoSpecularFactor <DOSPCF>
DoSpecularIntens <DOSPCI>
DoSpecularSwitch <DOSPCS>
DoSurfaceShade <DOSRFS>
DoTranspIntens <DOTI>
DoTranspSwitch <DOTS>
.)l
.H3 "Miscellaneous
Other renderer dependent primitive attributes used by the DROM
are:
.(l I
DoBackfaceCullSwitch <DOBFCS>
DoBackfaceCullable <DOBFC>
DoClipSwitch <DOCS>
DoClipVol <DOCV>
DoHiddenSurfSwitch <DOHSS>
DoInvisSwitch <DOINVS>
DoRepType <DOREPT>
.)l
.H2 "View Functions
The \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 device driver supports background color for
views through the call:
.(l I
DvSetBackgroundColor <DVSBC>
.)l
.H1 "Limitations
The \s-1TITAN\s+1 G2 device driver has the following limitations.
.BU
supports only ambient and infinite light types.
All other types will be approximated by one of these two types.
.BU
does not support the interpolation type \f2DcSurfaceShade\fP for
\f2DoInterpType\fP.
.BU
the \f2operator\fP parameter of the \f2DoClipVol\fP function is
ignored and is assumed to be \f2DcClipAnd\fP.
.BU
Only 8 clipping planes are supported.
.BU
Lines cannot be transparent.
