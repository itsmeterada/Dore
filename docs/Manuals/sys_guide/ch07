.lp
The PostScript device driver writes PostScript to a file using the
PS-Adobe-1.0 structuring convention.  Each device update produces 
a page of PostScript output that is appended to the specified 
output file.  The generated output file can be sent directly 
to a PostScript printer for printing.
.lp
The PostScript device driver generates the PostScript drawing commands
to display the geometry.  It does not perform hidden line or 
hidden surface removal except through backface culling.
The output file does not contain raster data, only drawing commands.
The output can be either color or greyscale.
.H1 "Using the Driver
A \*(Dd PostScript device object can be created using:
.(m
	DoDevice("ps", optionstring);
.)m
where "\f2ps\f1" is the device type and \f2optionstring\f1 is a list
of initialization options for the PostScript driver.
The \f2DoDevice <DOD>\f1 and \f2DdSetOptions <DDSO>\f1
manpages with PostScript driver-specific
information are provided in Section IV, \f2Manpages\f1, of this document.
.H3 "Initialization Options
The initialization options for the PostScript device driver are:
.ip "-noborder
specifies that no border be drawn around each view.
The default is to draw a border.
.ip "-filename \f2name\fP
specifies that the output PostScript file be named \f2name\fP.
The default name is \f2dore.ps\fP.
.ip "-visualtype \f2vtype\fP"
specifies the given visual type for the output.
The possible values for \f2vtype\fP are \f2DcTrueColor\fP for a
color image or \f2DcStaticGrey\fP for a greyscale image.
The default visual type is \f2DcTrueColor\fP.
.ip "-width \f2size\fP"
specifies the image width of the PostScript file in inches be \f2size\fP.
The default width is 8.5 inches.
.ip "-height \f2size\fP"
specifies the image height of the PostScript file in inches be \f2size\fP.
The default height is 8.5 inches.
.H3 "Modifying the Optional Values
The PostScript device driver allows modification of driver specific
values through the \f2DdSetOptions\fP call.
The following options can be changed via this call:
.ip "-border
specifies that a border be drawn around each view.
.ip "-noborder
specifies that no border be drawn around each view.
.rs
.sp -.5v
.H1 "Output Modules
The PostScript device driver supports only the 
dynamic renderer output module (DROM) interface; it does \f2not\fP support
the production renderer output module (PROM) interface.
.rs
.sp -.5v
.H1 "DROM Dependent Functions
When using the dynamic renderer, a function is supported only if
the DROM of the device driver being used also supports it.
Refer to Appendix A, \f2Supported Functions\fP, for a list of the
\*(Dd functions supported by the DROM used by the \*(CT.
.H1 "Limitations
The PostScript DROM has the following limitations:
.BU
It does not support the \f2DdInqPixelData\fP function.
.BU
It does not perform hidden surface removal.
All objects are drawn based on their order in the \*(Dd graphical
database.
.BU
It supports only ambient and infinite light types.
All other types will be approximated by one of these two types.
.BU
It does not support the interpolation type \f2DcSurfaceShade\fP for
\f2DoInterpType\fP.
.BU
It is best to use a white background and dark colored objects when
working in greyscale.
