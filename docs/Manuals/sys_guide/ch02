A \*(Dd \f2renderer\f1 is responsible for converting the 
graphical object database into an image.  Renderers vary in 
the techniques they use to draw the geometry of the objects 
and in the attributes they consider.  As a result, the way an image 
looks not only depends on the specific objects in the database, but 
also on which renderer is selected.
.lp
A renderer displays output through a \f2device driver\f1 using the 
device control module (DCM) functions and one of the output module interfaces.
A renderer can therefore work with any device driver that supports its 
required output module interface.  \*(Dd device drivers and the 
output modules that they support are described in Section III, 
\f2Device Drivers\f1.
.lp
If a renderer or device does not support a particular feature, it ignores it
or does the best that it can.  For example, if smooth shading is not supported, 
you may see only flat-shaded objects.  For this reason, you are encouraged 
to include all desired functionality in your \*(Dd application code,
especially when this code is being written for multiple configurations.
