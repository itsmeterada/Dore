.ds h1 10
.L1 S UN V IEW " CXP"
.L2 D RIVER
.CH TEN
.lp
The SunView CXP device driver provides access to the 3D graphics
accelerators on Sun Microsystems Sun/3 and Sun/4-CXP workstations.
The Sun/3-CXP and Sun/4-CXP are 8\-bit color workstations with CG
framebuffers and GP graphics accelerators, running the SunView
windowing system. 
The SunView CXP device driver makes use of the Sun GPSI Graphics
interface.
.H1 "Using the Driver
The initialization options for the SunView CXP device driver are:
.ip "-singlebuffered"
requests a single buffered window.
The default is a double buffered window.
.ip "-width \f2size\fP"
requests a width of \f2size\fP pixels for the window. 
The default width is 512.
.ip "-height \f2size\fP"
requests a height of \f2size\fP pixels for the window.
The default height is 512.
.ip "-canvas \f2canvasid\fP"
requests that the SunView canvas \f2canvasid\f1 opened by the application 
be used for drawing.  The \f2\-singlebuffered\fP, \f2\-width\fP, and 
\f2\-height\fP options are ignored when a canvas is specified.
.H1 "Output Modules
The SunView CXP device driver supports both the production renderer
output module (PROM) interface and the dynamic renderer output module
(DROM) interface.  The implementations of the PROM and DROM for the 
SunView CXP device driver will be referred to as the \f2SunView CXP PROM\f1 
and \f2Sunview CXP DROM\f1, respectively.
.H1 "PROM Dependent Functions
The interface to the PROM is a very simple one, intended for renderers
that generate pixel data, such as the standard production renderer.
The SunView CXP PROM implements all functions of the PROM interface.  As a result,
any renderer that uses the PROM interface will be fully supported by the
SunView CXP device driver.
.H1 "DROM Dependent Functions
When using the dynamic renderer, a function is supported only if the DROM
of the device driver being used also supports it.
The following subsections list the renderer dependent functions that
are supported by the SunView CXP DROM.
.H2 "Studio Attributes
The studio attributes are attributes that will be executed during a
studio traversal.
Studio attributes include camera and light attributes.
The SunView CXP DROM does not use any of the rendering control attributes.
.H3 "Camera Attributes
The camera attributes supported by the SunView CXP DROM are:
.(l I
DoCameraMatrix <DOCM>
DoParallel <DOPAR>
DoPerspective <DOPER>
DoProjection <DOPRJ>
.)l
.H3 "Lighting Attributes
The light attributes define the characteristics of the lights
used in a scene.
They are:
.(l I
DoLightColor <DOLC>
DoLightIntens <DOLI>
DoLightType <DOLTT>
.)l
.rs
.sp .5v
.H2 "Primitives
The SunView CXP DROM supports the five \f2base\fP primitives of the DROM
interface.  These are point lists, line lists, connected line lists,
triangle lists, and triangle meshes.
.rs
.sp .5v
.H2 "Primitive Attributes
The SunView CXP driver supports the following primitive attributes:
.rs
.sp .5v
.H3 "Shading Attributes
The shading attributes supported by the SunView CXP DROM are:
.(l I
DoAmbientIntens <DOAMBI>
DoAmbientSwitch <DOAMBS>
DoDepthCue <DODC>
DoDepthCueSwitch <DODCS>
DoDiffuseColor <DODIFC>
DoDiffuseIntens <DODIFI>
DoDiffuseSwitch <DODIFS>
DoInterpType <DOIT>
DoLightSwitch <DOLTS>
DoShadeIndex <DOSI>
DoSpecularColor <DOSPCC>
DoSpecularFactor <DOSPCF>
DoSpecularIntens <DOSPCI>
DoSpecularSwitch <DOSPCS>
DoSurfaceShade <DOSRFS>
.)l
.bp
.H3 "Miscellaneous
Other renderer dependent primitive attributes used by the SunView CXP DROM
are:
.(l I
DoBackfaceCullSwitch <DOBFCS>
DoBackfaceCullable <DOBFC>
DoHiddenSurfSwitch <DOHSS>
DoInvisSwitch <DOINVS>
DoRepType <DOREPT>
.)l
.H2 "View Functions
The SunView CXP DROM supports background color for
views through the call:
.(l I
DvSetBackgroundColor <DVSBC>
.)l
.H1 "Limitations
The SunView CXP DROM has the following limitations:
.BU
It supports only ambient and infinite light types.
All other types will be approximated by one of these two types.
.BU
It does not support the interpolation type \f2DcSurfaceShade\fP for
\f2DoInterpType\fP.
.BU
It does not support the \f2DdInqPixelData\fP function.
.H1 "Requirements
Applications built with a \*(Dd library that includes the SunView CXP
driver will require that the SunView libraries be linked into the
applications by using:
.(m
    -lsuntool -lsunwindow -lpixrect
