A renderer does not access a display medium directly.
Instead, it interacts with a device driver, which controls the
output from the renderer to the output device.  Every type of 
device \*- such as a file or 3D graphics display 
hardware \*- must have a device driver associated with it.
.lp
A \*(Dd device driver consists of several modules:  a required 
\f2device control module\f1 (DCM) and one or more \f2output modules\f1.  
Each type of output module handles a different type of renderer output.  
Some output modules are very simple, because most of the rendering computation 
is performed by the renderer.  Other output modules need to be more 
sophisticated, because they are expected to do most of the rendering work.
.lp
This section describes the device drivers available with this \*(Dd
release and the output modules that each of these drivers supports.
