Portable \*(Dd release 5.0 contains the \*(Dd source code and is 
structured to be easy to port to new platforms.
It is also operates without change for the sample configurations
provided.
Automatic procedures assist in building the \*(Dd library
for the sample configurations, as well as for new ports.
Documentation is provided to assist in writing \*(Dd application
programs, adding new renderers and device drivers to \*(Dd,
building the \*(Dd library, and porting \*(Dd to new platforms.
Several test programs are also provided to test the installation
of \*(Dd, the incorporation of any new renderers or device drivers,
and the porting to new platforms.
.H2 "Sample Configurations
Portable \*(Dd release 5.0 includes source code and makefiles
for building four different sample \*(Dd configurations:
.BU hs
The \f2iris\fP configuration 
runs on the Personal IRIS 4D series of workstations with color frame
buffer and Z-buffer, manufactured by Silicon Graphics Inc.
The SGI compatible cartridge tape distribution of Portable \*(Dd
also includes this configuration already built
into a library ready for use with \*(Dd applications.
.BU hs
The \f2suncxp\fP configuration
runs on a Sun/3- or Sun/4-CXP
8-bit color workstation with a CG frame buffer and a GP graphics
accelerator, manufactured by Sun Microsystems, running the SunView
windowing system. 
.BU hs
The \f2sungen\fP configuration
runs on a Sun/3 or Sun/4 black and white or 8-bit color workstation, 
manufactured by Sun Microsystems, running the SunView windowing system.
.BU hs
The \f2stdx\fP configuration
runs on systems that support the X11 Window System.
.rs
.sp -.5v
.H2 "Renderers"
.rs
.sp -.25v
The Portable \*(Dd release 5.0 includes three renderers.
The code for the renderers is contained in subdirectories under
\f2dore/src/render_config\fP.
The renderers are:
.BU hs
The standard production renderer 
is a spatial subdivision ray tracer, which performs
all rendering calculations in machine independent
software.
.BU hs
The dynamic renderer is 
designed for interactive graphics performance by taking advantage
of the host system's graphics display hardware
whenever possible.
.BU hs
The sample renderer in Appendix B is a toy renderer which
provides an
example of how renderers are interfaced to the \*(Dd system.
It is not intended to be used for useful rendering.
.rs
.sp -.25v
.lp
Every \*(Dd system configuration includes both the dynamic renderer
and the production renderer. In addition to the source code for these
two renderers, your distribution tape also includes the source code
of the sample renderer. 
However, since the sample renderer does not produce useful
graphical output, it is not installed in the \*(Dd system for any of the
configurations.
.rs
.sp -.25v
.lp
The dynamic renderer is used when the rendering style
(\f2DvSetRendStyle <DVSRS>\fP) is \f2DcRealTime <DCRLTM>\fP.  
The standard production renderer is used when the rendering style is
\f2DcProductionTime <DCPRTM>\fP. 
.rs

.H2 "Device Drivers
.rs
.sp -.25v
There are seven device drivers included in Portable \*(Dd release
5.0.
The device driver implementations are contained in directories under
\f2dore/src/device_config\fP.
.BU hs
The \f2gl\fP device driver provides access to the Silicon Graphics
Inc. Personal IRIS line of workstations.
The driver also includes code to access the advanced features of the 
Power Series VGX graphics subsystem.
.BU hs
The \f2ps\fP device driver writes PostScript drawing
commands to a file that can then be printed on any color or black and white
PostScript printer.
.BU hs
The \f2rasterfile\fP device driver writes an image to a file,
using the \*(Dd raster format.
.BU hs
The \f2stdx11\fP device driver provides access to devices that
support the X11 Protocol.
.BU hs
The \f2sunview_cxp\fP device driver provides access to the 3D
graphics accelerators on Sun Microsystems Sun/3-CXP and Sun/4-CXP 
workstations through the Sun GPSI interface.
.BU hs
The \f2sunview_gen\fP device driver provides access to black and
white or color Sun Microsystems workstations running the SunView windowing system.
Since no 3D graphics hardware support is provided, the device driver
uses a software implementation of the graphics pipeline for 
dynamic rendering.
.BU hs
The \f2sampledev\fP device driver is a sample driver that can be
used as a starting point for new device driver implementations.
.lp
The device drivers included in each sample \*(Dd configuration
are listed in the following table:

.lp
Your distribution tape includes the source code for the device
drivers corresponding to your \*(Dd system configuration.
In addition, the source code for the sample device driver is also
provided. However, since the sample device driver does not produce useful
graphical output, it is not installed in the \*(Dd system for any of the
configurations.
All of the device drivers, except the sample driver, are described
in more detail in  \f2Device Drivers\f1.
.lp
A device driver is accessed from \*(Dd applications by creating a
device object with a call to \f2DoDevice <DOD>\fP.
For example, in C:
.rs
.sp -.25v
.(m
     device = DoDevice ("type", "");
.)m
.rs
.sp -.25v
or, in \*(Fo:
.rs
.sp -.25v
.(m
     DEV = DOD('type', 4, '', 0)
.)m
.rs
.sp -.25v
The second parameter (or third, for \*(Fo) specifies optional 
initialization values for the device.
.rs
.sp -.25v
.H2 "Documentation
The following manuals are provided with Portable \*(Dd release 5.0:
.BU hs
The \f2\*(Dd Programmer's Guide\fP explains the key terms and concepts
of programming with the \*(Dd library, with sample code fragments
in C and \*(Fo.

of all \*(Dd functions in \f2manpage\f1 format, as well as information 
on raster data formats, transformation matrices used by \*(Dd, and a 
discussion on renderer-dependent features of \*(Dd.

renderers and device drivers to \*(Dd.
It also provides information for system programmers to help them
port \*(Dd to new platforms.
.BU hs
