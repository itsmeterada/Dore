The \*(Dd Rasterfile device driver writes a generated \*(Dd image to a file.
The file is written in the format described in the section on \f2Raster
File and Memory Formats\fP, in the \f2\*(Dd Reference Manual\fP, with 
the \f2r8g8b8\fP pixel data format.
The \*(Dd Rasterfile driver writes the image output from a renderer
directly to a file.  The image file written by the raster file driver
may later be used by the \*(Dd functions \f2DoFileRaster <DOFRS>\fP and 
\f2DsFileRasterRead <DSFRSR>\fP.
.H1 "Using the Driver
A \*(Dd Rasterfile device object can be created using:
.(m
	DoDevice("rasterfile", optionstring);
.)m
where "\f2rasterfile\f1" is the device type and \f2optionstring\f1 is
a list of initialization options for the \*(Dd Rasterfile driver.
The \f2DoDevice <DOD>\f1 and \f2DdSetOptions <DDSO>\f1
manpages with \*(Dd Rasterfile driver-specific
information are provided in Section IV, \f2Manpages\f1, of this document.
.H3 "Initialization Options"
The initialization options for the \*(Dd Rasterfile device driver are:
.ip "-width \f2size\fP"
specifies a width of \f2size\fP for the raster file image.
The default width is 512.
.ip "-height \f2size\fP"
specifies a height of \f2size\fP for the raster file image.
The default height is 512.
.ip "-filename \f2name\fP"
specifies that the raster file be named \f2name\fP.
The default name is \f2test.img\fP.
.lp
None of the \*(Dd Rasterfile options are modifiable after initialization.
.H1 "Output Modules
The \*(Dd Rasterfile device driver supports only the production
renderer output module (PROM) interface; it does \f2not\f1 support
the dynamic renderer output module (DROM) interface.
.H1 "PROM Dependent Functions
The interface to the PROM is a very simple one, intended for renderers
that generate pixel data, such as the standard production renderer.
The \*(Dd Rasterfile PROM implements all functions of the PROM interface.  
As a result, any renderer that uses the PROM interface will be fully 
supported by the \*(Dd Rasterfile device driver.
.H1 "Limitations
The \*(Dd Rasterfile device driver has the following limitations.
.BU
It does not support the \f2DdInqPixelData\fP function.
.BU
Each successive device update will overwrite the previous image in
the file.
