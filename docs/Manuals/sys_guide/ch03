The \*(Dd standard production renderer is a spatial subdivision raytracer,
which performs all rendering calculations using portable machine
independent software.
It has the ability to generate images with transparency, reflections,
and shadows, along with many of the other standard \*(Dd attributes.

Refer to Appendix A, \f2Supported Functions\fP, for a list of the
\*(Dd functions supported by the standard production renderer.
Any unsupported attribute included in a \*(Dd scene description will 
be ignored by the renderer.

.H1 "Device Driver Support
.rs
.sp -.25v
The standard production renderer requires only the production renderer
output module (PROM) interface in addition to the device control
module (DCM) interface.  The standard production renderer will work
with any device that supports the PROM interface.
See Section III of this document for more information on device drivers.

.H1 "Limitations
.rs
.sp -.25v
The standard production renderer has the following limitations.
.BU hs
It does not support texture mapping.
.BU hs
It does not support vertex colors for primitives.
.BU hs
It does not render line or point primitives or any frame space
primitives like annotation text (\f2DoAnnoText\fP) or polymarkers
(\f2DoPolymarker\fP).
.BU hs
It does not support antialiasing.
.BU hs
It always performs light source shading (i.e., ignores
\f2DoSurfaceShade\fP and assumes \f2DcShaderLightSource\fP).
.BU hs
It only displays surfaces as surfaces (i.e., ignores \f2DoRepType\fP).
.BU hs
It only supports ambient and infinite lights types.
