This manual is a reference for version 5.0 of \*(Dd, a  
three-dimensional computer graphics subroutine library.  
Programmers using this manual should already be
familiar with \*(Dd fundamentals.
For detailed examples of \*(Dd application programs, refer to
the \f2\*(Dd Programmer's Guide\fP.

This manual has the following chapters:
.BU hs
Chapter 1,
\f2\*(Fo Cross Reference\f1,
is an alphabetic list of the \*(Fo functions,
constants, and types that \*(Dd uses, with their
corresponding C names. 
.BU hs
Chapter 2,
\f2Quick Reference\f1,
lists each \*(Dd function with its arguments
and a short description.
.BU hs
Chapter 3,
\f2C Include Files\f1,
lists the data type structures, constants, and function declarations
used by \*(Dd applications written in C.  Function
prototypes for \*(Dd are also included in this chapter.
.BU hs
Chapter 4,
\f2\*(Fo Include Files\f1,
lists the data types, constants, and function declarations used by \*(Dd
applications written in \*(Fo.
.BU hs
Chapter 5,
\f2\*(Dd Vertex Types\f1,
describes how to enter vertex information for \*(Dd primitive
objects.
.BU hs
Chapter 6,
\f2\*(Dd Matrix Transformations\f1,
explains how \*(Dd manipulates its transformation matrix and shows
the matrix equations that are used by \*(Dd functions.
.BU hs
Chapter 7, 
\f2Raster File and Memory Formats\f1, 
describes the file and memory data format for raster data used by \*(Dd.
.BU hs
Chapter 8,
\f2Device Drivers and Renderers\f1,
contains general information about \*(Dd device drivers and renderers,
along with a list of the \*(Dd functions that are renderer dependent.

.H1 "Intended Audience"
This manual is written for the experienced programmer 
who is already comfortable writing
graphics applications.  The manpages provide the calling sequences 
and return values that apply
when the \*(Do routines are called from the C and \*(Fo
programming languages.
If you are 
unfamiliar with C or \*(Fo, or with computer graphics programming,
consult the related readings listed below.
