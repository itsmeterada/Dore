This chapter contains a listing of the \*(Dd include files
for use with application programs written in \*(Fo.
These files define all of the \*(Dd variables and functions
and are located in the \f2/usr/include/fortran\fP directory.
.lp
The following is a list of these \*(Fo include files with
a description of the routines that should use these files.  The
files are listed in the order in which they appear in this chapter:
.ip \f2DORE\f1
must be included by all application routines
.ip \f2DORETEXT\f1
must be included by those application routines that use
text attributes
.ip \f2DOREMETHODS\f1
must be included by those application routines that
implement user-defined primitives
.lp
