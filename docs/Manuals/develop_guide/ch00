This manual is a guide to adding device drivers and renderers 
to version 
5.0 of \*(Dd, a three-dimensional computer graphics 
subroutine library.
It also provides information to assist system 
programmers in porting \*(Dd to new computer platforms. 
.lp
This manual is intended for Portable \*(Dd users, and users of
the \*(Dd Developer's Toolkit.
It is assumed you are already familiar with the concepts and terms 
of \*(Dd application programming, as
described in the \f2\*(Dd Programmer's Guide\fP and the
\f2\*(Dd Reference Manual\fP. 
.H1 "Chapter Summaries
The chapters of this manual are grouped in seven main sections:
.sp
\f3Section I, Introduction\f1
.BU hs
Chapter 1, \f2\*(Dd Overview\f1, discusses the unique 
features of \*(Dd.
.BU hs
Chapter 2, \f2\*(Dd Functional Structure\f1, provides a broad overview
of the overall functional structure of the implementation of \*(Dd.
.BU hs
Chapter 3, \f2Classes and Methods\f1, discusses some basic concepts
of \*(Dd classes and methods, 
including information on the stacking mechanism
used for keeping track of current attribute values.
.lp
\f3Section II, Renderers\f1
.BU hs
Chapter 4, \f2Renderers Section Introduction\f1, is an 
overview of the section.
.BU hs
Chapter 5, \f2Rendering Process\f1, offers an overview of the concepts
involved in the
\*(Dd rendering process: updating the renderer state, performing
the studio and display traversals of the database, and sending
output data to a \*(Dd device output module.
.BU hs
Chapter 6, \f2Interfacing a Renderer\f1, is a step-by-step description of how
to adapt and add an existing renderer to the \*(Dd system.
.BU hs
Chapter 7, \f2Sample Renderer\f1, shows how a sample renderer can be added
to \*(Dd, following the steps described in the previous chapter.
.lp
\f3Section III, Device Drivers\f1
.BU hs
Chapter 8, \f2Device Drivers Section
Introduction\f1, is an overview of the section.
.BU hs
Chapter 9, \f2Device Driver Modules and Interfaces\f1, 
describes the device driver modules and the
interfaces that provide access to them.
.BU hs
Chapter 10, \f2Implementing a Device Driver\f1, 
is a step-by-step description
of how to implement a new device driver. 
.BU hs
Chapter 11, \f2Sample Device Driver\f1, describes a sample device driver
written using the steps described in the previous chapter.
.lp
\f3Section IV, Porting\f1
.BU hs
Chapter 12, \f2Porting Section Introduction\f1, 
provides an overview of the section, as
well as information on the platform requirements for a \*(Dd port.
.BU hs
Chapter 13, \f2\*(Dd Implementation Conventions\f1, 
describes the \*(Dd naming
conventions and the \*(Dd source code directory structure.
.BU hs
Chapter 14, \f2Building the Sample Configurations\f1, 
explains how to build 
and install the \*(Dd library. 
In particular, this chapter describes the steps for building
the sample configurations provided with Portable \*(Dd.
.BU hs
Chapter 15, \f2Porting \*(Dd\f1, describes the porting process, including
how to control the build process, and how to copy template modules
for new module implementations. 
.lp
\f3Section V, Testing\f1
.BU hs
Chapter 16, \f2Testing \*(Dd\f1, shows how to build and use the sample test
and demonstration programs provided with Portable \*(Dd.
.lp
\f3Section VII, Appendices\f1
.BU hs
Appendix A, \f2Glossary\f1, contains definitions for some 
\*(Dd programming terms, as well as terms used in this manual for 
internal \*(Dd concepts.
.BU hs
Appendix B, \f2Global Attribute Access\f1, 
contains the calling sequences for
the method routines of the standard method "InqGlobalValue".
This method is used during traversals
to query the current value of attributes.
.BU hs
Appendix C, \f2Object Data Structures\f1, 
describes some of the data structures
used by the \*(Dd system to store information specific to objects.
.lp
You will need to read one or more or these sections, depending
on what you plan to do with \*(Dd as a developer.
In all cases you should start by reading
Section I, \f2Introduction\fP,
before going on to read other sections.
It includes an overview of the functional structure of \*(Dd.
Section V, \f2Testing\fP, and
Section VII, \f2Appendices\fP, 
are also useful to all \*(Dd developers.
.lp
If you want to adapt a renderer to use with \*(Dd, read:
.BU hs
Section I, \f2Introduction\fP
.BU hs
Section II, \f2Renderers\fP
.BU hs
Section V, \f2Testing\fP
.lp
You will also need to refer to the \f2Developer's Interface Functions\fP
manpages.
.lp
If you want to implement a \*(Dd device driver to support new 
types of output devices, read:
.BU hs
Section I, \f2Introduction\fP
.BU hs
Section III, \f2Device Drivers\fP
.BU hs
Section V, \f2Testing\fP
.lp
You will also need to refer to the \f2Device Driver Interface Functions\fP
manpages.
.lp
