This directory contains the troff files necessary to print
out the 5.0 Dore Developer's Guide.  To print them, use
the dpx utility.  The instructions and options are given in
the manpage /usr/local/lib/dpx/doc/dpx.txt

We recommend that you put the macros in /usr/local/lib/dpx.
If you want to put them in another directory, you must change
the .so line in each file.  Also, there are references to
other macros in the local.me file.  There may be other cross
references to macros which will have to be searched out.

If you are going to print out double-sided copy, remember to insert blank pages
so that each chapter has an even number of pages.

======================

To display the files on the screen, use:

nroff -me <filename> | more

They will be readable, but some of the formatting characters will show.

=======================
Undocumented help for dpx:

To run "mkindx", you must set the following:
"setenv INDEXFILE index_file"

To run ANYTHING, you must set the following in your PATH:
"usr/local/lib/dpx/bin" 

Check for the use of "delim" in in the files.
The "delim" statement must come after the
".so ../macros/<macro file>".

Running Chapter 11 with the -debug option causes dpx to complain mightily
about missing fonts.  This is because of the subscripts.
The chapter prints out correctly, however.
