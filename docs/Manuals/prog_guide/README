Note I have added the script build.  This should work on a groff
install system with the macros directory installed in ../macros.

Directories:
	PS	- These files were retreived from MacDraw and converted
		  to PICT -> GIF -> EPS
	PS.no 	- worked with an old system
	PS.old	- don't know

=============================================================================
This directory contains the troff files necessary to print
out the 5.0 Dore Programmers Guide.  To print them, use
the dpx utility.  The instructions and options are given in
the manpage /usr/local/lib/dpx/doc/dpx.txt

We recommend that you put the macros in /usr/local/lib/dpx.
If you want to put them in another directory, you must change
the .so line in each file.  Also, there are references to 
other macros in the local.me file.  There may be other cross
references to macros which will have to be searched out.

At this time (12/94), the picture files are not available.  However,
the references have been left in so the pagination does not
change too much.  The pagination may change a little towards
the end of each chapter, but each new chapter starts on the
correct page.

Because the postscript files are not available, dpx will generate
errors.  This will not affect the printed pages.

If you are going to print out double-sided copy, insert blank pages
so that each chapter has an even number of pages.

======================
 
To display the files on the screen, use:
 
nroff -me <filename> | more
 
They will be readable, but some of the formatting characters will show.
 
=======================
Undocumented help for dpx:
 
To run "mkindx", you must set the following:
"setenv INDEXFILE index_file"
 
To run ANYTHING, you must set the following in your PATH:
"usr/local/lib/dpx/bin" 
 
Check for the use of "delim" in in the files.
The "delim" statement must come after the
".so ../macros/<macro file>".
