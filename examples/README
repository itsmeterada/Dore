This is the Dore examples directory. It contains the source code for
many working example Dore programs and tools, and the makefile to build them.
Included here are the following:

	generic: contains two generic main routines "render.c" and run.c".
		These routines are used by some of the example programs
		to create working executables.

	programs: contains some complete example programs which demonstrate
                various Dore features. The example called "simple" is the
                first example to look at if you are just starting to learn
                Dore. The example called "fortran" is not automatically
                built when you type "make" in this directory. However if you
                have a Fortran compiler, you can "cd" to programs/fortran and
                build the example by typing "make".

	util:	contains some useful tools built on top of Dore. These
		utilities are good examples of programming with
		Dore.  Many of these utility routines are used by the
		example programs.

	makefile: builds all the example code.
		Type "make" or "make single" to build everything in
                single precision, or "make double" for double precision.
		Type "make clean" to remove all objects and executables.

	README: this file.



In order to run any Dore programs that draw to the graphics console,
The environment variable DISPLAY must be set and the X11 server and window
manager must be running.
