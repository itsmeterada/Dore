				VIEWS

This program demonstrates the use of multiple views in a single Dore frame.
The object displayed in all views is a dynamic model of a solar system.
The bottom two views are a stereo pair (viewed from two slightly different
angles).  The top right view is a bird's eye view.  The view point for the
top left view is from a point on the surface of the planet.  This last view
is accomplished by adding a camera into the description of the planet, and
then using the solar system model for both that view's display AND camera
groups.
