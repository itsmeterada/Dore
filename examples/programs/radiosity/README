                 RADIOSITY

This example program shows how to use radiosity in Dore.
It creates a 5-sided "Cornell" box with an area light source
and two simple objects inside the box. Once the convergence
criterion is met, the camera is moved around without a need
for recomputing the radiosity solution. Note the color bleeding
where the sides of the box meet, and also the soft shadows
projected by the objects onto the "floor" of the box.
