				KNOBS

This program demonstrates the use of the knobs and transformer utilities.
A hermite patch object is created and displayed.  The user then
manipulates it via the knob box.  The top three knobs on the left side
of the knob box control the x, y, and z rotations, while the right three
knobs control the x, y, and z translations.  Two transformers are used to
do this.  The rorate transformer affects before the translate transformer
(because both transformers are post_concatenating and the rotate transformer
is before the translate transformer in the group).  New transformations
that arrive via the knobs are post concatenated onto the appropriate
transformer which causes all transformations to happen in screen space.
This particular combination makes it easy for a person to easily orient an
object in three space.

To exit the program, turn the bottom right knob.  This knob is connected to
an input slot which contains a single valuator that sets a global
"done" flag which is checked in the main loop.
