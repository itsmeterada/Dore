                                STEREO

Example program of using the TITAN Stereo Viewer with X+ and Dore'.

The program will at first show a static stereo image in a window on the
screen. A carriage return will cause the objects to rotate for a while.
A second carriage return will exit the program.

To run:
     0: make sure your monitor supports stereo mode, not all monitors do.
     1: make sure X+ is running in stereo mode. One way of starting 
        the server in stereo mode is to type:
        xinit  -- /usr/bin/Xtitan -stereo
     2: type (<ALT><F2>) then open a window there with the right mouse
        button.
     3: type: "render" from that xterm window
