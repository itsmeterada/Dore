This program creates and displays a fractal landscape.
To run type "render -input filename", where "filename" is
a landspace data file.  Other options which may be used are
"-smooth 0" to turn off the smoothing of the surface and
"-l #" to specify the initial lake level.

The program "gendata" generates new landscape data files.
Gendata requires a recursion level specified when called. For example,
"gendata 6 > data.6" requests recursion to 6 levels.
It uses a random initial seed if none is given with the "-i #" option.
If invoked with "gendata -i 123 7 > data.7" the value "123" is used as
the initial seed.

Other options are: The option "-g initfile" reads a file of initial
height values from which to recurse.
The option "-s #" takes a scale factor to be used at each level of
recursion.  The default scale factor is 1.
The option "-n" supresses the use of color, and "-v" causes the
output to be written in the form that the "-g" option accepts.

Once the render program has begun, it prompts for new water levels
and then redraws at the new level. The water starts at level = -.75
and reasonable values range from -2.0 to 1.0.

For example, type:
     gendata 6 > data.6
     render -input data.6
