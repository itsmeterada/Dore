				PICKING

This program demonstrates examples of the following:
	1: Dore picking functionality.
	2: Creating most kinds of Dore primitives.
	3: printing of primitives
	4: Dore "compute bounding volume" functionality.
	5: creating single buffered, double buffered and stereo windows.
	   suitable for passing to Dore for those applications that need the
	   handle of the Dore window.
	6: using overlay graphics with the Direct Graphics Interface.

This program must open its own window to pass to Dore instead of simply
having Dore do it because it needs the window handle in order to track the
position of the pointer in the window which is used to select pick points.
An overlay window is also created which overlaps the Dore window.  The program
uses this window to draw a box around the pick aperture so that the user can
see which objects will be picked.

There are three command line options that may be specified:

The width of the pick aperture can be specified with the -xap option, and the
height with the -yap option.  To use a 30 by 40 pick aperture, give the command:
	render -xap 30 -yap 40

The other option is to run in stereo.  If you have a stereo monitor and want
to run this program in stereo, you need to do the following things:
	1: use the -stereo option to xinit
	2: in an xterm window, type "setenv DISPLAY unix:0.1 ; awm &"
	3: hit <ALT><F2> to toggle to the stereo screen
	4: create an xterm window on that screen with the right mouse button
	5: run the program from that window with the stereo option:
		render -stereo 1
