                            PSEUDO

This example program demonstrates the use of pseudo color Dore devices.
A spinning cube and sphere are displayed.
The program prompts the user for the visual type device desired.

If the shade mode is DcComponent (the default) the program initializes
the color table with a 3,3,2 color table (3 bits red, 3 bits green, 2 bits
blue) and uses flat shading (the default interp type). Color interpolation
does not make sense for DcComponent type devices.

If the shade mode is DcRange, then the program partitions the color table 
into two shade ranges; one for shades of "silver" and one for "gold".
It assigns the cube to the "silver" shade range, and the sphere to "gold" (via
DoShadeIndex).  It also specifies that smooth shading for the sphere
because color interpolation does make sense for DcRange type devices.
The background color is also mapped to a shade of silver.

NOTE: Initially the image will not be rendered correctly. To fix this,
simply move the X pointer into the Dore window.
