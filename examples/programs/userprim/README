                                USERPRIM

This example shows how to create and use a new user-defined primitive.
All creation, maintenance and rendering functions are defined in
lbracket.c. The file render.c contains a short application program
that uses the new primitive.

The usage for the new primitive function is:

   DtObject DUoLbracket(side1, side2, width, thickness)
   DtReal side1, side2, width, thickness;

   DUoLbracket creates a primitive object that defines an L-bracket shape.
   The parameters specify the dimensions of the L-bracket. The call
   will fail if any of the parameters are less than zero.
