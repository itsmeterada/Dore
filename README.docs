Because of their size, the extensive Dore' documentation has been
bundled separately from the main Dore' distribution. You should
be able to `drop' it into the tree however, by extracting it, and then
editting docs/Imakefile's SUBDIRS line.

Remember to remake the Makefiles (with `make Makefiles').
