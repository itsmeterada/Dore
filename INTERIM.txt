I've just finished uploading a much-improved interim release of Dore'
onto sunsite. I have to apologize for the length of time this has taken
(it's been a couple of weeks), but I hope you'll agree that it's
worth the wait.

This is version 6.01.

Changes included in this release (off the top of my head):
+ now builds with Imake
  + will build both shared and unshared libraries, at the same time!
  + the NT build has been integrated
+ significantly cleaned up the source tree
+ manpages have been renamed to their longer names
+ renamed conflicting source files - more will be happening with this
+ unbundled the docs from the main distribution, to cut down on size
+ the demo code now supports poll() and select().
  - I'm not sure how to approach this for NT.
+ PostScript versions of the manpages are available in the
  documentation bundle.

You can find the source and documentation on sunsite.unc.edu (the
official Dore' archive) in pub/packages/development/graphics/Dore as
dore601.tar.gz (~1.9MB) and dore601.docs.tar.gz (~2.9MB). There are 500k
chunked versions available in the split/ directory.

Make sure you read the README file and follow its instructions!
Especially for determining the BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS and fiddling with
the config/cf/site.def file.

I've built the distribution on both NetBSD 1.0 and Solaris 2.3. Ther
should be no problems building on any other Unix-type system.
There may be slight build problems on NT. The modified macros at the
top of config/cf/DoreLib.tmpl may need to be changed.

Send patches, bug-reports, etc. to me.

Thanks!

PS: I realize I forgot to remove the Solaris'isms from config/cf/site.def.
    These shouldn't make a diffeent though.
