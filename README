Welcome to Dore'!

This is Dore' 6.01, an interim release intended to fix bugs
in the build process, and to perform some cosmetic changes.
Please test and excercise it, and report any bugs or problems
you may find to me (my address is below).

There is a list of known outstanding bugs in the file `BUGS'.


INTRODUCTION:
=============

On January 18th, 1995, Kubota Graphics Corp released Dore' 6.0, a
commercial 3D graphics API, to the public for free, as they were soon
to cease operation.

About that time, I was looking for an available 3D API to experiment
with. One requirement was that it be free, and support zbuffering,
and backface culling. Anything else was an extra :)  Dore' satisfies
all this, and much more. Dore' is a great gift to the public.

Dore' still needs much work. And I can't do it all myself,
primarily due to lack of time, and lack of hardware.
This has to be a collective effort. So please, if you can, choose
an aspect of Dore' that you think needs improvement, let me know
about it, and then go to work! I'll try to coordinate things as best
I can. The file PROJECTS has some things that need to be worked on.

Building Instructions:

Dore' now builds using Imake. Imake is a complex beast, but there
are relatively few options that need to be set for Dore'. For more
information specifically on Imake, refer to the release notes from
the X Window System (this particular Imake set was taken from
X11R6/XFree86 3.1). One of the advantages of this Imake setup is
that it is possible to build both normal and shared libraries at
the same time!

Edit config/cf/site.def to suit. The relevant options are in
the AfterVendorCF section. You should be able to simply follow
the comments. The build is set up for a `generic' Unix system running
X11. If you have more esoteric hardware, you may want to change the setups.

Look in config/cf for a .cf file describing your setup, such as
sun.cf for a SunOS or Solaris system. Read over any comments, and
also check in the file, for a line of the form

    #define BootstrapCFlags  <bootstrap-options>
    
Make note of the <bootstrap-options>, as you'll be using it soon.
Don't worry if your .cf file doesn't have a BootstrapCFlags line.

Once you have completed this, run the following:

    make -f Makefile.ini BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="<bootstrap-options>" \
	World 2>&1 | tee world.log

where <bootstrap-options> is the value you recorded from above.
This process will build the Dore' library, the demo programs
(surprisingly found in demo/), and some test programs.

If the build is successful, then you can install the various components
with

    make install

If you want the man pages, then also specify the `install.man' target.
