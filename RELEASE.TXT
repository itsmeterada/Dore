As many of you might have heard Kubota Graphics Corporation will, for all
practical purposes, cease engineering operations on February 1, 1995. For the
lack of much to do here at Kubota for the past 6 months, except for putting out
maintenance releases (ho-hum), we thought that it might be fun to put Dore' out
on to the public domain. So we have cleaned it up a little bit, ported and made
sure that it works on Linux, FreeBSD and NT. Today, we at Kubota Graphics are
proud to announce Public Domain Dore' (Dore 6.0). We certainly hope that it
will be the next big graphics API ;-) Enjoy!

Hi Dore' fans!
          I am really heartened by the response I got to the message I posted
yesterday announcing the release of Dore' 6.0 from Kubota. Some clarifications
that I thought I should make in response to the e-mail and phone calls:

 1) Kubota has released the copyright to the public. So you are free to make
    modifications but cannot claim authorship. You are free to make changes
    and modifications as long as the copyright message is included.

 2) Many people asked where exactly on susiste and cdrom were the files
    located. I apologize for not mentioning this earlier. Anyway, I just
    uploaded the files yesterday. The file is called:

     pdore-6.0.tar.Z (about 7.25 Mb)
                     (about 25 Mb uncompressed)

    On sunsite I uploaded it to /uploads &
    on ftp.cdrom.com I uploaded it to /incoming
   
    The tar file does not have the Dore' libraries built for any system.
    It has complete sources and excellent documentation (man pages, ps
    files, troff and tools)


Alright folks! Looks like there is a lot of interest in Dore' especially
in Europe. I'm glad Kubota allowed us to do this. Hope all of you find it
useful.
