#ident "%W%" %G%
 
This is a test of the Dore "groups" functionality. All group commands
are used and tested.  In this test, typical uses of each function are
and verified, but most of the functions are used in a straightforward way.

No image is generated. The program is validated completely from
the diognostics printed on the terminal. Some minor errors are purposely
generated to verify that they are trapped and that the proper Dore error
message printed. These error messages are bracketed by diognostic lines.
True test failures are reported with lines beginning "*** test failed ...".
