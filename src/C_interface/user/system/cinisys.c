         This file has been obsolesced, and is replaced by the macro
     DsInitializeSystem defined in dore.h.  The new macro invocation
     is implemented to ensure that the both application code and the
     Dore' library agree on the precision of a DtReal type.  And hey,
     no need to clutter up Dore' when we can use a macro, eh?
