WARNING: 
The Dore' run-time messages are stored in the file "errmsgfile" 
in this directory.  The makefile in this directory controls the
creation of "errmsgfile", using the awk script "error_filter" and
the include file "error.h" in $(DORE_LOC)/dore/include/dore_develop
Never edit "errmsgfile" in this directory. To add an error message 
you must add it to the "error.h" include file and do a make from 
here to create "errmsgfile"
