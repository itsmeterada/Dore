EXISTING BUGS:
  + Casting errors, unimplemented routines for NT/kopengl
  + prototype errors with includes vs code
  + palette management problems (apparent during the demos)
  + the test programs dump core in malloc()
  + the tests and examples programs haven't been converted to
    Imake yet, so their status is unknown.
  + some of the examples are hard-coded to specific display types
  + Imake build doesn't do depending yet

BUGS FIXED:
  + the make process is pretty horrible
  + font compiler does not return with valid exit codes
  + demos only supported poll() -  added support for select()
  + problems with loading under NT with the WinNT nmake-makefile
      - hopefully fixed with new Imake configuration
  + font compiler (dfc) includes <sys/dir.h> unnecessarily
  + problems compiling demos
  + changed fonts and errmsgfile problems
  + hard-coded cc in some makefiles
