 * For the .cf files shipped in this release, the main variables in this     *

/**********************************************************************\
The following make variables will affect what devices and options are to
be build into Dore'. 

EXTRA_DEFINES
   This is a set of C options that will be defined for all sources.
   Some systems (apparently the Titans) may need -DXLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS.
   You should put any -I directives for includes needed for device includes
   You can force a Dore' library to use single or double precision
     arithmetic by specifying -DDORE_REAL_SINGLE or -DDORE_REAL_DOUBLE
     respectively.

DORE_NAME
   This is the base name of the library to be generated (on Unix
     systems, something like `libDORE_NAME.a').

DORE_SYSTEM
   This is a single word describing which machine configuration Dore'
     should be built for.
   Choose from:
    alpha dec-mips iris kopengl sample st1500 st2000 st3000
    stdx suncxp sungen titang2

DORE_RNDS
   A list of all renderers to be included in the Dore' build.
   Choose from:
    dynrnd glbrnd mlr samplernd
   Note: only the Titans use mlr, and samplernd is non-functional

DORE_DEVS
   This is a list of all device drivers that should be built into Dore'.
   Choose from:
    g4vll gl kopengl pex ps rasterfile sampledev soft_tools stdx11 
    sunview_cxp sunview_gen template vll x11_DGL x11_XFDI x11_titang2

DORE_DEV_LIBS
   This is a set of linker flags necessary to include the required device
     libraries for the devices specified in DORE_DEVS, for linking programs.

DORE_FORTRAN
   This specifies for which Fortran vendor to compile the Dore'
     Fortran wrappers.
   Choose one of:
    alpha none sun titan

DORE_OS
    This specifies which OS Dore' will run on. This does very little,
      at present.
    Choose one of:
     unix nt
