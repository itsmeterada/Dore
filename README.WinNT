Notes on building Dore' for Windows NT:

1. You need to use NTFS for the long filenames. The Dore tree can have
   some fairly long file names.

2. The NT port hasn't been tested extensively. It seems to work. It 
   uses the aux toolkit to open the device and such unlike the unix-opengl
   port which uses glx.
